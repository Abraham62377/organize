**The file management automation tool.**

`organize` is installed via pip (requirement: Python 3.3+):

``$ pip3 install organize-tool``

Run the script with:

``$ organize``


Why you might find this useful
------------------------------
Your desktop is a mess? You cannot find anything in your downloads and
documents? Sorting and renaming all these files by hand is too tedious?
**Time to automate it once and benefit from it forever**.

The following yaml code goes into a file named `config.yaml` in the folder
shown with ``$ organize config``:

- `config.yaml`:

  .. code:: yaml

      rules:
        - folders:
            - ~/Desktop
            - ~/Downloads
          filters:
            - Extension:
                - png
                - jpg
            - LastModified:
                days: 365
          actions:
            - Trash

``$ organize run`` will now move all PNGs and JPGs older than one year from your
desktop and downloads folder into the trash. It is that easy.

Feeling insecure? Run ``$ organize sim`` to see what would happen without
touching your files.

But there is more. You want to move files, use custom
shell scripts or match filenames with regular expressions?
`organize` has you covered. You can even use template strings and extract
information from your files.

Have a look at the full documentation at https://organize.readthedocs.io/.
