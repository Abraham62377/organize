    """
    Delete a file from disk.

    Deleted files have no recovery option!
    Using the `Trash` action is strongly advised for most use-cases!

    Example:
        - Delete all JPGs and PNGs on the desktop which are older than one year:

          .. code-block:: yaml
            :caption: config.yaml

            rules:
              - folders: '~/Desktop'
              - filters:
                  - lastmodified:
                      - days: 365
                  - extension:
                      - png
                      - jpg
              - actions:
                  - delete
