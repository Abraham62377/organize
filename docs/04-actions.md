# Actions

This page shows the specifics of each action. For basic action usage and options have a
look at the [Config](01-config.md) section.

## copy

::: organize.actions.copy.Copy

## delete

::: organize.actions.delete.Delete

```yaml
rules:
  - locations: "~/Downloads"
  - filters:
      - lastmodified:
          days: 365
      - extension:
          - png
          - jpg
  - actions:
      - delete
```

## echo

::: organize.actions.Echo

<details><summary>Examples</summary>
Prints "Found old file" for each file older than one year:

```yaml
rules:
  - locations: ~/Desktop
    filters:
      - lastmodified:
          days: 365
    actions:
      - echo: "Found old file"
```

Prints "Hello World!" and filepath for each file on the desktop:

```yaml
:caption: config.yaml

rules:
  - locations:
      - ~/Desktop
    actions:
      - echo: "Hello World! {path}"
```

This will print something like `Found a PNG: "test.png"` for each file on your desktop

```yaml

  - locations:
      - ~/Desktop
    filters:
      - Extension
    actions:
      - echo: 'Found a {extension.upper}: "{path.name}"'
```

Show the `{basedir}` and `{path}` of all files in '~/Downloads', '~/Desktop' and their subfolders:

```yaml
:caption: config.yaml

rules:
  - locations:
      - ~/Desktop
      - ~/Downloads
    subfolders: true
    actions:
      - echo: "Basedir: {basedir}"
