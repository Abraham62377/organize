# Filters

This page shows the specifics of each filter. For basic filter usage and options have a
look at the [Config](01-config.md) section.

(for example "Nikon D3200", "iPhone 6s", "iPhone 5s", "DMC-GX80") and move the pictures
accordingly:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "camera sort"

          startswith: A
          contains: hole

            - "6"
          endswith: _end
          case_sensitive: false
    actions:
      - echo: "Found a match."
```

## python

::: organize.filters.Python

**Examples:**

```yaml
rules:
  - name: A file name reverser.
    locations: ~/Documents
    filters:
      - extension
      - python: |
          return {"reversed_name": path.stem[::-1]}
    actions:
      - rename: "{python.reversed_name}.{extension}"
```

A filter for odd student numbers. Assuming the folder `~/Students` contains
the files `student-01.jpg`, `student-01.txt`, `student-02.txt` and
`student-03.txt` this rule will print
`"Odd student numbers: student-01.txt"` and
`"Odd student numbers: student-03.txt"`

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Filter odd student numbers"
    locations: ~/Students/
    filters:
      - python: |
          return int(path.stem.split('-')[1]) % 2 == 1
    actions:
      - echo: "Odd student numbers: {path.name}"
```

Advanced usecase. You can access data from previous filters in your python code.
This can be used to match files and capturing names with a regular expression
and then renaming the files with the output of your python script.

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Access placeholders in python filter"
    locations: files
    filters:
      - extension: txt
      - regex: (?P<firstname>\w+)-(?P<lastname>\w+)\..*
      - python: |
          emails = {
              "Betts": "dbetts@mail.de",
              "Cornish": "acornish@google.com",
              "Bean": "dbean@aol.com",
              "Frey": "l-frey@frey.org",
          }
          if regex.lastname in emails: # get emails from wherever
              return {"mail": emails[regex.lastname]}
    actions:
      - rename: "{python.mail}.txt"
```

Result:

- `Devonte-Betts.txt` becomes `dbetts@mail.de.txt`
- `Alaina-Cornish.txt` becomes `acornish@google.com.txt`
- `Dimitri-Bean.txt` becomes `dbean@aol.com.txt`
- `Lowri-Frey.txt` becomes `l-frey@frey.org.txt`
- `Someunknown-User.txt` remains unchanged because the email is not found

## regex

::: organize.filters.Regex

**Examples:**

Match an invoice with a regular expression:

```yaml
rules:
  - locations: "~/Desktop"
    filters:
      - regex: '^RG(\d{12})-sig\.pdf$'
    actions:
      - move: "~/Documents/Invoices/1und1/"
```

Match and extract data from filenames with regex named groups:
This is just like the previous example but we rename the invoice using
the invoice number extracted via the regular expression and the named
group `the_number`.

```yaml
rules:
  - locations: ~/Desktop
    filters:
      - regex: '^RG(?P<the_number>\d{12})-sig\.pdf$'
    actions:
      - move: ~/Documents/Invoices/1und1/{regex.the_number}.pdf
```

## size

::: organize.filters.Size

**Examples:**

Trash big downloads:

```yaml
rules:
  - locations: "~/Downloads"
    targets: files
    filters:
      - size: "> 0.5 GB"
    actions:
      - trash
```

Move all JPEGS bigger > 1MB and <10 MB. Search all subfolders and keep the
original relative path.

```yaml
rules:
  - locations:
      - path: "~/Pictures"
        max_depth: null
    filters:
      - extension:
          - jpg
          - jpeg
      - size: ">1mb, <10mb"
    actions:
      - move: "~/Pictures/sorted/{relative_path}/"
```
